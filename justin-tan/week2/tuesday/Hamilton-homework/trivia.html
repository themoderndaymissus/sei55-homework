            <h2>Technology was as it's infancy when Hamilton wrote her program for the Apollo 11 landing. </h2>
            <h3 class="hide">When the Apollo missions were planned, the process of writing code began on large sheets of paper. A keypunch operator would create holes in paper cards, keying the codes into what were called punch cards. Even with access to computer, it only contained 4 kilobytes of read-write memory and 72 kilobytes of read-only memory. </h3>

            <h2>There was a critical moment of the Apollo 11 mission that could abort the landing, however Hamilton had prepared for this situation years ago.</h2>
            <h3 class="hide">Three minutes before the lunar lander reached the Moon's surface, several computer alarms were triggered. For a moment Mission Control faced a “go / no-go” decision, but with high confidence in the software developed by computer scientist Margaret Hamilton and her team, they told the astronauts to proceed. The software, which allowed the computer to recognize error messages and ignore low-priority tasks, continued to guide astronauts to their landing. In other words, the software was not only informing everyone that there was a hardware-related problem, but that the software was also compensating for it. An investigation would eventually show that the astronauts’ checklist was at fault, telling them to set the rendezvous radar hardware switch incorrectly.

            <h2>In 2019, to celebrate 50 years to the Apollo landing, Google decided to make a tribute to Hamilton.</h2>
            <h3 class="hide">The tribute was created by positioning over 107,000 mirrors at the Ivanpah Solar Facility in the Mojave Desert to reflect the light of the moon, instead of the sun, like the mirrors normally do. The result is a 1.4-square-mile portrait of Margaret, bigger than New York’s Central Park.

            <h2>Food for thought</h2>
            <h3 class="hide">Programmers back in the days do not have fancy computers, no auto-check, no autofills and autoclose, no internet, no fancy IDEs, no debugger, and so on. Now is a great time to be in!</h3>
